        <p>
          The study followed 500 participants over the course of two years,
          during which time they were asked to engage in at least 30 minutes of
          moderate exercise per day, five days per week. The participants were
          also monitored for changes in their health and fitness levels.

          <p>
            "The results of our study were truly remarkable," said lead
            researcher Dr. Sarah Johnson. "We found that even moderate exercise
            can have a significant impact on a person's health and well-being."
          </p>

        <p>Some of the key findings from the study include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A 25% reduction in the risk of heart disease among participants who
            engaged in regular exercise
          </li>
          <li>A 30% reduction in the risk of developing diabetes</li>
          <li>
            An improvement in overall fitness levels among all participants

              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are the results from the study:</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Group</th>
              <th>Average Fitness Level</th>
              <th>Heart Disease Risk Reduction</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Exercise Group</td>
              <td>80%</td>
              <td>25%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Control Group</td>
              <td>60%</td>
              <td>5%</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
