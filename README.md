# Bones CSS

Simple, Beautiful, Lightweight, CSS boilerplate for prototypes

[Homepage, documentation, examples](https://alexradulescu.github.io/bones-css/)

## How to use it

Simply copy&paste the following code in the `<head>` of your `index.html`

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@alex.radulescu/bones-css@0.6.6/dist/bones.0a1299eb.css"
/>
```

### What and why

Bones is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (some of the quite creativey). Nothing more.

- Less 600 lines of CSS unminified (without comments)
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS
- Perfect for small prototypes, quick tutorials, miniprojects
- Not good for larger stuff because
  - It only styles raw html elements, missing many other things
  - It might override other framework styles

## Requests, suggestions

For any requests or suggestions, please raise an issue with a clear, detailed description.

## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Edge latest
- Safari latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Bones works great with any browser supporting css grid and flexbox.
